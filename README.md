# ✅ Todo App – State Management Practice Project

A **frontend-focused Todo application** built to strengthen and compare **core React state management techniques**. This project intentionally uses **multiple approaches** — `useState`, `useReducer`, and **Redux Toolkit** — to gain hands-on experience and understand their **real-world use cases**.

> 🎯 Primary Goal: **Concept clarity over UI complexity**

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Understand **when & why** to use different state management techniques
* Compare **local vs global** state handling
* Improve frontend architecture & logic clarity
* Build predictable and scalable state flows

---

## ✨ Features
